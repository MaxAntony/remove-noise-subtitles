# Delete unnecessary content in subtitle files 

this is a cli tool that delete unnecessary content which can be found in srt subtitle files

## instalation

```
npm i -g remove-noise-subtitles
```

## supported formats

- srt

## example
maybe you see in a video you saw subtitles that looked this:
```
Hello, and welcome to the complete JavaScript course.
                       2
```
this tool for now can only remove number two leaving it like this:
```
Hello, and welcome to the complete JavaScript course.
```
and that's it.
